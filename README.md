# ðŸ§  Attention Mechanism - Transformer Architecture

Welcome to the **Attention Mechanism - Transformer Architecture** project! This project focuses on implementing the attention mechanism, a core component of the **Transformer architecture**, widely used in natural language processing and other AI applications. The Transformer model revolutionized AI with its ability to handle sequences in parallel, enabling faster and more effective learning.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Implements self-attention to capture dependencies between input tokens regardless of their distance within the sequence.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Utilizes multiple attention heads to learn different aspects of relationships in the data simultaneously.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional encoding to retain order information in the input sequences.
- **End-to-End Transformer Architecture**: Builds the Transformer layers, including encoder and decoder stacks, to demonstrate the full power of the model.
